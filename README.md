## Build / Journal

Document every step:  

1. Design in Tinkercad → export STL files  
2. 3D print case → sand / fit / assemble  
3. Mount Raspberry Pi, screen, fan, power supply  
4. Wire everything neat + manage cables  
5. Install Raspberry Pi OS → setup emulators → test  
6. Theme GUI for retro vibes  
7. Take pics/screenshots for proof / Blueprint journal
